# TOWER_DEFENCE_GAME
ABOUT PROJECT:
----------------
1) This is a simple 2-D Game built-in Python from scratch with an interest in Gaming.
2) In this game, we have to kill the enemies before they reach the end of the tower. This game contains almost 15 levels with 4 different upgrading versions of turrets. And 4 different levels of enemies. (Slow, Medium, Fast, Elite).
3) We can upgrade turrets, buy turrets and place them at different locations for attacking the enemies.
4) The game finishes when we lose all our lives or all the enemies were killed.
5) Used Py-game library for implementing the gaming features.
6) Utilized the 2-d tiled editor to create the game world and processed data from the .tmj file.
7) Used Spritesheets for the turret animations.
8) Added a piece of soothing background music for a better experience for the user.
